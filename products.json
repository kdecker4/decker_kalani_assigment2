It is an invasive species that can cause significant damage to Hawaii's forests and increase the number of fruit fly pests. Strawberry guava can form thickets that block shade, making it difficult for other species to coexist. It can also tolerate shade and heavy leaf litter, and may produce chemicals in its leaves that prevent other plants from growing. In some areas, strawberry guava has already reduced groundwater recharge by 85 million gallons per day.",
